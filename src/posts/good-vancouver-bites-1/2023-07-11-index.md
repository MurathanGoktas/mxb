Eating is definitely a huge portion of what I enjoy (and spend). Since my teenage years, I have had a habit to spend nothing of my budget on clothing and spare it for food. It is still the case. 

As such a person I love being in Vancouver. It has a very but very very diverse food scene. You can compare the sushi quality to Japan, and the pasta quality to Italy… 

Here  I just want to document a few of the amazing bites I had in this city. I don't remember their name and all ingredients, but I will explain as I can.

  <figcaption>This butternut squash-filled pasta at Oca Pastifico is one of the top pasta I’ve ever had. As a huge fan of butternut squash, it is hard for me to dislike any food with it. But the freshness, quality and harmony of everything makes this a top-level. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>This is the bite at Dachi everyone looks for in the summer. After this plate I found the farmer of each plant on the table and bought plenty more for home (really). For how many plates do you do that in your life? </figcaption>

  <figcaption>The crustiness of the skin and the smoothness of the sauce makes this sablefish a top-class at Labbatoir. Thanks to sablefish, there is at least a local fish that I like. </figcaption>
