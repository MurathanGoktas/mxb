                <p>Probabilistic data structures can provide memory efficiency in large genomics experiments with tunable false positive rates (FPR). Bloom filter (BF) is one of bioinformatics’s most widely used probabilistic data structures. BF is a membership data structure to query the presence or absence of an element in a set.</p>
<p>BFs are extensively used in applications such as contamination screening, quality assessing, or De Bruijn Graph representation. BF does not store associated data with k-mers and therefore does not provide any associative information about k-mers indexed. Thus, to leverage the memory efficiency of BF in other domains, such as classification, researchers looked for ways to extend the capabilities of BF by workflows.</p>

  <figcaption>Tree-based and matrix-based associative Bloom filter-based data structures. Black boxes represent ‘1’ and white boxes represent ‘0’ in Bloom filters. Sequence Bloom trees (left) stores BFs in a binary tree. To query the membership of a sequence of sets, query operation starts in the root node only the corresponding sets of the leaf nodes returned. BIGSI (right) stores multiple BFs together in a matrix shaped. Each column is a BF of a set and the matrix BF is stored row-wise for cache optimization. </figcaption>

                <p>Eating is definitely a huge portion of what I enjoy (and spend). Since my teenage years, I have had a habit to spend nothing of my budget on clothing and spare it for food. It is still the case.</p>
<p>As such a person I love being in Vancouver. It has a very but very very diverse food scene. You can compare the sushi quality to Japan, and the pasta quality to Italy…</p>
<p>Here  I just want to document a few of the amazing bites I had in this city. I don’t remember their name and all ingredients, but I will explain as I can.</p>

  <figcaption>The sushi assortment at Sushi Hil. This is a very special sushi place that deserves every compliment and sushi aburi sitting a the middle of this row will be one the favourite bites of my life. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>This butternut squash-filled pasta at Oca Pastifico is one of the top pasta I’ve ever had. As a huge fan of butternut squash, it is hard for me to dislike any food with it. But the freshness, quality and harmony of everything makes this a top-level. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>This is the bite at Dachi everyone looks for in the summer. After this plate I found the farmer of each plant on the table and bought plenty more for home (really). For how many plates do you do that in your life? </figcaption>

  <figcaption>The crustiness of the skin and the smoothness of the sauce makes this sablefish a top-class at Labbatoir. Thanks to sablefish, there is at least a local fish that I like. </figcaption>
